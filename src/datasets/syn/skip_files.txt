# Files to skip during Phase 2 HumSyn audio generation
# Updated: 2026-01-28
#
# Reason: kern quality issues that cannot be fixed automatically
# - offsetInScore negative: spine timing errors in original kern file
# - tuplet markers misaligned: *tuplet and *Xtuplet not tracking spines correctly
#
# Total: 8 Chopin files

# Caused by negative delta time / offsetInScore errors
